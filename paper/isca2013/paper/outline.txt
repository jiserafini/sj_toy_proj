1. Intro.

2. Mobile Powr Behaviors

2.1 CPU Power
- Util, freq, # of cores - Complete
/* - May be able to use memory-intensive applications (?) future work */
---> power model

- Hot Pluggins latency vs powor
- latency, DVFS, hot pluggins, idle mode (?) - Complete
- iso-preformance power curve (perfect parallelism) - Complete


2.2. Utilization and Power Management

- on-demand power managmenet + hot-pluggin


3. TLP Behavior of Mobile Applications


- Phase Definition

- Per-phase utilization graph?

- Available Parallelism 

(Active threads --> )

- Dominant threads (utilization %)


--> different utilization behaviors for three phases
--> imperfect parallelism
--> dominant threads

4. TLP-aware/Phase-aware DVFS

1) DT-aware scheduling
-> balanced utlization
--> DT --> less util fluctuation

2) Phase-aware UP-threshold 

--> variance

3) TLP-aware Packing 

---> power model
