\subsection*{Abstract}

As smartphones proliferate, dominating mobile platforms, understanding 
the power behaviors of smartphones and their applications 
has become critical to overcome their battery limitation. However, 
the applications running on the smartphones
are mostly sensitive to user interaction, and their behaviors are quite
different from the traditional benchmark applications used for desktop and
server platforms. This paper characterizes the power behaviors of
multi-cores used in commercial smartphones, and the parallelism and CPU utility
of such interactive smartphone applications. This study shows how the application
phases are delimited by user interactions and how much thread-level parallelism
exists in different interaction phases. This paper also analyzes the existing 
power management schemes for smartphones, and discuss future improvements 
considering application behaviors.
