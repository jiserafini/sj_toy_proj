This paper characterizes the power behaviors of smartphone multi-cores and interactive applications. 
Although the number of cores are increasing, the available TLP is still limited in the interactive
applications. Furthermore, without per-DVFS, the current power management may not achieve the optimal
DVFS management. Also, modeling the interactive behaviors of applications, including required computation and
TLP, can open a new opportunity to further optimize the power management, which will be our future work.
